# DeaDBeeF-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of the deadbeef music player: https://github.com/DeaDBeeF-Player/deadbeef

Uses the portable Build of DeaDBeeF from here and turns it into an AppImage: https://sourceforge.net/projects/deadbeef/files/travis/linux/

You can also run the `deadbeef-appimage.sh` or `deadbeef-stable-appimage.sh` script in your machine to make the AppImage.

It is possible that these appimages may fail to work with appimagelauncher, since appimagelauncher is pretty much dead I recommend this alternative: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM
